# Blog App - Django
## Introduction
This is a simple blog application built with *Django* as part of a personal study project. \
The goal of this project was to learn and implement the core concepts of Django, \
including models, views, templates, forms, and the Django admin interface.

## Features
- **Post Creation**: Create, edit, and delete blog posts.
- **Post Listing**: View a list of all blog posts.
- **Post Detail**: View the details of a specific blog post.
- **User Authentication**: Register, login, and logout for user management.
- **Admin Interface**: Easy management of posts via Djangoâ€™s built-in admin interface (I haven't turned off debug mode because this is a learning oriented project).

## Technologies Used
- **Django**
- **SQLite**
- **Bootstrap 5**
- **HTML, CSS, JS (ECMAScript)**
